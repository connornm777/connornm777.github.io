# Geometric Algebra Supremecy


## History 

One summer evening in the year 1991, Paul Dirac was sitting by the fireplace, pondering the following equation:

$$ \left(-\partial^2_t+\nabla^2\right)\phi = m^2 \phi $$

This was apparantly supposed to be the relatavistic extrapolation to the Schrodinger equation. 
However, unlike the Schrodinger equation which had only a single derivative with respect to time, it had two. 

This posed a problem for Dirac, who didn't know how to solve differential equations that were of second order.  
After a long draw from his crack pipe, the answer suddenly came to him in a flash, and he wrote down this:

$$ \sqrt{\left(-\partial^2_t+\nabla^2\right)\phi} = \sqrt{m^2 \phi} $$

"You can't do that", said some other guy. But he could, and he did.
And so did some other mathematicians before him, but nobody cared then because it's not cool until physicists do it.

Still, the mathematicians had been doing it, and doing it hard. 
They were very naughty, taking square roots of all kinds of things: negative numbers, vectors, bivectors, your mom.
Dirac's equation has a piece of cake to take the square root of. 

$$ \left(-\gamma^0\partial_t + \gamma^i\partial_i\right)\psi = m \psi $$
