# GA Supremecy

## History 

One summer evening in the year 1991, Paul Dirac was sitting by the fireplace, pondering the following equation:

$$ g_{\mu\nu}\partial^{\mu}\partial^{\nu}\phi = m^2 \phi $$

This was supposed to be the relatavistic extrapolation to the Schrodinger equation. 
However, unlike the Schrodinger equation which had only a single derivative with respect to time, it had two. 

This posed a problem for Dirac, who didn't know how to solve differential equations of second order.  
After a long draw from his crack pipe, the voices in his head told him to write down this:

$$ \sqrt{g_{\mu\nu}\partial^{\mu}\partial^{\nu}\phi} = \sqrt{m^2 \phi} $$

"You can't do that", said some other guy. But he could, and he did.
And so did some other mathematicians before him, but nobody cared then because it's not cool until physicists do it.

Still, the mathematicians had been doing it, and doing it hard. 
They were very naughty, taking square roots of all kinds of things: negative numbers, vectors, bivectors, your mom.
Dirac's equation was easy to take the square root of.

The result? 

$$ \gamma_{\mu}\partial^{\mu}\psi = m \psi $$
$$ \{\gamma_{\mu}, \gamma_{\nu}\} = 2g_{\mu\nu}$$

So isn't $\psi\propto m^{1/2}$, since it's the square root of $\phi$ apparantly?
Why does everyone treat it like $\psi\propto m^{3/2}$? Wat the hell is it?
Also, when you take square root on the right hand side, don't you get + or -? 
Isn't $\gamma_{\mu}\partial^{\mu}\psi\psi = -m \psi$ just as valid of a solution?
What are you even doing Dirac?!

"Those are obviously positrons, a particle that has never been observed that I just made up. It's like an electron with positive charge.
It's a form of antimatter, which I also decided to invent just now. But whatever I call it, my equation definitely isn't wrong. Don't worry about the
fact that there is apparently way more matter than antimatter even though all equations are symmetric with their exchange. Isn't physics fun?", he said.

And so the Dirac equation was established, initiating a rich tradition of mathematical buffoonery making a mockery of 
first principle thinking and thought experiments in physics. 
Dirac then proceeded to go senile and fall into [numerology conspiracy theories.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_large_numbers_hypothesis)
