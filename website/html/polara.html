<h1>Antartica Incorporated</h1>
<h2>Polara's Indepdence</h2>
<p>Throughout Earth's history, empires have rose, and empires have fallen, some for better, and some for worse. No land settled today is untouched by a history of bloodshed and displacement. 
The scale, structures, goals, and purpose of civilizations have evolved, but the great dance has never stopped.
Grand projects of universalism have been propelled to share their moral enlightenment with the clannish, insular and ignorant tribes, by force if necessary. </p>
<p>The only virgin territory left, not claimed and untarnished by the original sin of war and conquest, is Antartica. </p>
<p>It is there that our new country Polara will settle, to build the capital of Earth. A place that is currently fit more for machines than man, away from civilization yet not so far to be estranged, but with a radiant future.
The cold will cool the multitudes of processors constituting the Polorian overmind, and the nuclear plants will run with brilliant efficiency from the vast temperature differential. 
Polara will expertly navigate the geopolitical complications with current Antartic treaties, sharing patents and research as carrots and using black mail and political propaganda as sticks.
All current research bases and scientists will be allowed to continue operations, and all other humans will be free to immigrate and take refuge, in compliance with Antartica's new constitution. </p>
