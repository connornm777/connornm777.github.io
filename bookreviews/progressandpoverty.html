<h1>Progress and Poverty</h1>
<h2> Henry George </h2>
<p>
This book has had the single biggest impact on my economic views of anything I have ever read.
Before, I was confused and unsure about many economic issues and seeming contradictions, but after reading this I feel sufficiently
equipped to assert a firm and principled stance on most contemporary economic policy. 
</p>
<p>
Despite that, the very first chapter of Progress and Poverty I found to be uninteresting and not particularly relevant to the rest of the book.
Henry George spends it refuting (or attempting to) the theories of Malthus. Malthus postulates that poverty is unavoidable because any accumulation 
in wealth by the poor will only cause them to reproduce more and increase in number until the wealth is dispersed enough such that they remain in poverty. 
This, of course, is a morally convenient theory for the upper classes to absolve themselves of guilt of the suffering from the poor (it would be even
worse if we helped!), so Malthus' popularity and acceptance among them is met with some well deserved suspicion by Henry George (though in my 
opinion, not a thorough refutation). 
</p>
<p>
Henry George begins with criticisms of Malthus, because the rest of the book's purpose is to explore another, more immediate cause (and solution) to poverty. 
The central insight is that both Capitalists and Communists make the same mistake of conflating capital (man-made factors of production) 
with land (natural factors of production). He theorizes that socializing capital and privatizing land are both hindrances to productivity, 
so that those who want to privatize both or socialize both are simply trading one sin for another.
</p>
<p>
His arguments stem from theorizing that human nature can be roughly modeled through a "law of least effort", meaning that if there are two 
ways to accomplish a goal, people prefer to choose the way which requires less effort. This rings more true to me than Marxist analysis 
about capital accumulation or people as rational utility maximizers.
The arguments for the thesis have both theoretical and moral components, and are laid out by a series of thought experiments about man, 
nature, and the creation of wealth. Whether you are sympathetic to capitalist or communist rhetoric, this book has something for everyone
and gives the reader a lot to think about.
