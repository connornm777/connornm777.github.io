<h1>The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism</h1>
<h2> Daniel Bell </h2>
<p>
This was a pretty good book that explored the history of capitalist countries, and in particular the United States. 
Bell argues that the Puritans that came to the US from Europe believed in a moral imperative to work hard, consume little, and live simply.
This created an economic and social surplus that allowed the US to accumulate capital and expand, eventually culminating in it's pre-eminent
dominance on the world stage. 
</p>
<p>
However, these religious and cultural drives that build wealth, are themselves dissipated by that wealth. 
The rationale for new peoples and posterior generations to adopt and uphold this system are fundamentally materialistic, 
which is directly at odds with the asceticism required to build it in the first place.
</p>
<p>
There is a trope in the US of a hard working immigrant, looking for a better life, only to have their children become Americanized, with 
each passing generation becoming more consumerist and further believing hard work is for suckers. Of course, it is possible to fend off this 
trend, but the pretexts for doing so aren't usually due to the personal utility gained by the agents in the way  
capitalist economists would model. The Amish don't live the way they do because it is easy or efficient, but because they have beliefs that 
take precedence over personal utility and they insulate themselves from the larger American culture.
</p>
<p>
Bell restates this basic central thesis in several ways, but a prescription or solution is ultimately not provided, and the 
end is left inconclusive. He also spends a few chapters talking about trends in art, about different styles such as modernism, 
but I found those not very interesting and having little to do with the rest of the book.
</p>
<p>
Overall this book examines an interesting question, one which is implicit in many social issues about the incentives of individuals 
and their relationship to society, but not usually clarified in such detail.
