<h1>Valuing Options</h1>

<p>
As someone with a casual interest in finance, the main analysis I've come across online for options prices is the Black-Scholes equation.
This uses an indirect argument about no arbitrage conditions and creating a portfolio that is neutral with respect to the price of an
underlying asset to value an option on that asset. However, it assumes the evolution takes a certain shape, a geometric random walk
with a "volatility" parameter \(\sigma\). 
</p>
<p>
This analysis is unsatisfactory in my opinion. Options contain information about probabilities over expected future prices, which 
in general could have arbitrary shapes that incorporate "qualitative" information particular to an asset or industry. A good subjective Bayesian 
should leave those proababilities in place for full generality, then later substitute a particular form of for the probability distribution, 
where it is clear what assumptions are being made to determine that form. 
</p>

<h2>Call Option Price</h2>

<p>
A call option is a contract that gives someone the right to buy an asset at a price called the strike price, and expires 
after a time. American options can be executed at any time before the expiration, but European options must be executed only on the day it
expires. 
</p>
<p>
Let us consider the expected value of a European option, for now negelecting the time value of money (this will be easy to inset into our analysis). 
If the current value of the asset is \(S\), and the final value of the asset is \(S^\prime\), we could imagine a probability distribution
\(P(S^\prime|S)\) over the future asset price given the current asset price.
</p>
<p>
The option has value only if \(S^\prime-S_0 > 0\), and it's value will be equal to \(S^\prime-S_0\), otherwise it is worth \(0\). 
The price of the option (\(V_c\)) should then just be equal to the expected value, or the sum of values given a final price times it's probability: 
</p>
$$ V_c = \int_{S_0}^{\infty} dS^{\prime} P(S^{\prime} | S)(S^{\prime}-S_0) $$
<p>
Discrepencies between the market price of \(V_c\) and pricing due to a more informed estimation of \(P(S^\prime | S)\) indicate 
oppurtunites to turn a profit (or a loss if the market does indeed have a more accurate forecast). 
</p>

<h2>Black-Scholes Equation</h2>

<p>
The Black-Scholes equation makes \(P(S^\prime | S)\) depend on time explicitly, and assumes a distribution of the form:
</p>

$$ P_t(S^\prime | S)= \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi (T-t)}}\exp[-\frac{1}{\sigma^2(T-t)}\left(\log(S^\prime/S)-\mu(T-t)\right)^2] $$

Where \(t\) is time, \(T\) is the time left until the option expires at \(t=0\), \(\sigma\) is the volatility
