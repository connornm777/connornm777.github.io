<h1>Toy Model of Schrodinger Equation</h1>

<p>
From a functional form perspective, the Schrodinger equation isn't actually that bizarre. 
You can finesse a completely classical system to look like it. 
The confusion with quantum mechanics arise completely from the novel interpretation; when a bell is oscillating 
in a superposition between two eigenstates, we wouldn't dare ask what the probability of it being in either eigenstate is. 
It's quite clearly in both!
