<h1>The Anatomy of a Bubble</h1>
<p>
Most people have some intuitive idea of what it means for something to be overpriced, or to be in a bubble.
Value investors may try to independently calculate their own estimate of the value of an asset using fundamentals or
industry knowledge, then declare that there is a bubble if the prices are much higher than their estimates. 
Usually it boils down to simply noting that prices are anomalously high or rapidly increasing more than they would expect them to. 
</p>
<p>
The theory is that eventually the price will tend towards the value estimated (never mind that that value of course can also 
change with time!). Of course, this is complicated by the fact that 
people often make mistakes, are misled, and that an "estimated value" is after all just an abstraction of preferences, while the price something
is bought and sold for right now is declared in definite certainty every time it is traded. What our commentariat and investors 
are really trying to discern, are prices in the future.
</p>
<p>
In addition to these actors, there is another group who may believe the value of the asset to be much lower than the current price, 
but buy anyway because they believe in the short term the price will go even higher, and they can find a "bigger sucker" to sell to. 
This is the logic behind the theory of a "rational bubble", where prices of assets are not tied to fundamentals independent of other's 
beliefs about prices, but are subject to a self-perpetuating process. 
</p>
<h2>Timing the Market</h2>
<p>
It is one matter to determine that an asset is overvalued, or in a bubble. But it's another entirely to take advantage 
of this fact skillfully for monetary gain. Of particular importance are two questions.
</p>
<ul>
<li>How high will it go?</li>
<li>How long will it last?</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have not seen analysis attempting to tackle how these may be predicted. It is possible that the dynamics of a bubble are chaotic
in the mathematical sense, making it difficult to predict from estimates in initial conditions in the first place. But there 
are some quantities that we would naturally expect to effect these values of peak and time scale, or at least allow us to 
get a Fermi estimate. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Supply of asset</li>
<li>Cumulative net worth of all those interested in buying asset</li>
<li>Rate of information travel about asset</li>
</ul>
<p>
I'd expect the cumulative net worth to be proportional to the peak price, and time the bubble last to by inversely proportional 
to the rate of information travel in the market. Those things aren't usually directly measurable, but are guessable for a good ball-park reality check.
But we can attempt to get more precise and capture some dynamics in a toy model. 
</p>
<h2>Tulips</h2>
<p>
Let us consider a tulip market, where tulips are a fungible asset trading at a current particular price, \(P^*\). 
The participants in this market will each have their own estimate of what tulips should really be worth, based on what they think future prices 
will be and their own risk-adjusted calculations for opportunities to profit. Whatever goes into their reasoning, sound or faulty, we 
may at any point in time say that their personal estimate \(P\) is such that if it is greater than the current trading price \(P\gt P^*\), they
will want to buy tulips, and if it is lower \(P\lt P^*\), they will sell any tulips they can. 
</p>
<p>
Each trader will also have some amount of money \(M\), and some amount of tulips \(T\). It will turn out that particpants who never buy or sell tulips 
will not effect the price, so we can consider them non-participants. But for the participants, there exists a three variable distribution. 
We will say that \(n(P, M, T)\) is the number of people who value tulips at \(P\), have 
\(M\) dollars, and own \(T\) tulips. We can consider these continuous to account for small differences, and note that:

$$\int_0^{\infty}dP\int_0^{\infty}dM\int_0^{\infty}dT \bigl(n(P,M,T)\bigr)=N$$

Where \(N\) is the number of participants in the market. The total amount of money and tulips \(M_{\text{tot}}\) and \(T_{\text{tot}}\) 
respectively, can also be calculated:

$$\int_0^{\infty}dP\int_0^{\infty}dM\int_0^{\infty}dT \bigl(M n(P,M,T)\bigr)=M_{\text{tot}}$$
$$\int_0^{\infty}dP\int_0^{\infty}dM\int_0^{\infty}dT \bigl(T n(P,M,T)\bigr)=T_{\text{tot}}$$
<h2>Supply=Demand</h2>

The number of tulips being sold on the market will be equal to the number of tulips owned by individuals whose personal estimate in value is lower than
the current market price. This can be quantified by the integral:

$$ Q_S(P^*)=\int_0^{P^*}dP\int_0^{\infty}dM\int_0^{\infty}dT\bigl(T n(P,M,T)\bigr)$$

The number of tulips bought on the market will be equal to the amount of money owned by invidiuals whose estimate in value is higher than the 
current market price, divided by the current market price. This can be quantified by the integral:


$$ Q_D(P^*)=\frac{1}{P^*}\int_{P^*}^{\infty}dP\int_0^{\infty}dM\int_0^{\infty}dT\bigl(M n(P,M,T)\bigr)$$

The number of tulips sold must be equal to the number of tulips bought. Therefore, we have the condition:

$$ Q_S(P^*)=Q_D(P^*) $$
$$ \implies \int_0^{P^*}dP\int_0^{\infty}dM\int_0^{\infty}dT\bigl(T n(P,M,T)\bigr)
=\frac{1}{P^*}\int_{P^*}^{\infty}dP\int_0^{\infty}dM\int_0^{\infty}dT\bigl(M n(P,M,T)\bigr)$$

The last equation is an implicit expression for how the price \(P^*\) depends on the distributions of wealth, supply of tulips, and beliefs
about value among the population of market participants. In theory the price is a functional \(P^*[n]\) of this three variable distribution, 
though it is by no means easy to isolate it and find a closed expression from the implicit equation. At the very least it can be 
found computationally. 

<h2>All Money is Overvalued</h2>
<p>
Perhaps the best example of an asset deriving it's value from this source of self-reference is money. Money has value mainly because 
people believe it has value, and they believe it has value because other people believe it has value. If people started thinking houses
or cars were worthless, I would be plenty happy to live and drive in them cheaply and not care about their opinion. But if people thought my cash is
worthless, the most I could get out of it would be to use it as toilet paper.  
</p>
<p>
It may seem provocative to talk about all money in a post about bubbles, which include things like tulip mania and the 2008 housing crisis. 
I assure that my point is not that of a libertarian gold-bug, since the majority of value of gold and crypto also has a similar proximate source 
(aside from use in electronics of gold).
A qualitative difference between fiat currencies and these other examples is that fiats
are usually issued by a government with a vested interest in making sure it is stable, and has resources such as an
army, law-makers, and officials to take physical coordinated action. But since these services are funded by the very currency they are
trying to protect, the main differentiators between fiats and other bubbles is one of size and time-scales.
