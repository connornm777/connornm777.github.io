<h1>Marginalism and the Labor Theory of Value</h1>
<p>
Karl Marx begins his magnus opus <em>Das Kapital</em> with an extended discussion about the concept of "value". 
He notes the fact that a coat made from wool is usually traded for more wool than it contains. Therefore, the labor that 
went into the coat commands some amount of wool, and this extra leverage commanded in trade is "value".
Owners who profit then must somehow be exploiting labor by capturing some "surplus value". 
</p>
<p>
The crucial mistake made by Marx is that not <em>all</em> value is derived from labor. 
Consider a coat factory that spends \(L\) amount on labor, and \(X\) amount on all expenses that aren't labor (land, machines, sheep, ect)<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. 
It's revenue is surely a function of these two input \(R(L, X)\), and it's profits would be:
</p>
$$P(L,X)=R(L,X)-L-X$$
<p>
If we were to create a clone of this factory, then we would simply double all these extensive variables. 
In other words, if we imagine we have twice as much labor <em> and </em> twice as much of everything else that produces revenue and profits, then
both our profits and revenue will double (ignoring network effects and economies of scale, and assuming the factory is small enough to not 
satiate consumer demand)<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>.  
</p>
$$R(2L, 2X)=2R(L, X)$$
$$\implies P(2L, 2X) = 2 P(L, X) $$
<p>

<p>
The revenue must surely be a increasing function with respect to increasing \(L\) and \(X\), because even in the worst case scenario where extra labor or other resources
aren't needed, you can pay some workers to do nothing or scrap the leftover resources. This doesn't decrease revenue. We must therefore have: 
</p>

$$R(2L, 2X) > R(2L, X) > R(L, X) $$

<p>
The more resources, whether $L$ or $X$, the more revenue. 
</p>

<p>
Whether profits are increased for each step is less clear. 
</p>
$$P(2L, X)-P(L,X) = R(2L, X) - R(L, X) - L > 0 ?$$
$$P(2L, 2X)-P(2L,X) = R(2L, 2X) - R(2L, X) - X > 0 ?$$

<p>
If our orginal profits were positive, then it is easy to see that \(P(2L, 2X)-P(L, X) > 0 \), and the net profits from doubling both $X$ and $L$ increases profits. 
However, it is completely possible that doubling either alone could <em> decrease </em> profits and then doubling the other more than compensates to make up for the decrease. 
</p>

<p>
The condition for doubling the labor to be profitable can be seen to be.
</p>

$$ R(2L, X) - R(L, X) > L $$

<p>
Which there isn't

<p id="footnote-1">[1] Or, as Henry George argued, land may be considered as the only source of wealth besides labor, but for a broad definition of economic "land".</p>
<p id="footnote-2">[2] This approximation is exact if you cloned the whole earth including the consumers and casually isolated the systems, 
and is a better approximation the more the system resembles that scenario. Another factory built in a geographically distinct market with little overlap between customers
and seperate workers for each factory should follow this approximation very well. </p>
