<h1>Marginalism and the Labor Theory of Value</h1>
<p>
Karl Marx begins his magnus opus <em>Das Kapital</em> with an extended discussion about the concept of "value". 
He notes the fact that a coat made from wool is usually traded for more wool than it contains. Thereore, the labor that 
went into the coat commands some amount of wool, and the universalization of this extra leverage commanded in trade is "value".
</p>
<p>
The crucial mistake made by Marx is that not <em>all</em> value is derived from labor. 
Consider a coat factory that spends \(L\) amount on labor, and \(X\) amount on all expenses that aren't labor (land, machines, sheep, ect). 
It's revenue is surely a function of these two input \(R(L, X)\), and it's profits would be:
</p>
$$P(L,X)=R(L,X)-L-X$$
<p>
If we were to create a clone of this factory
