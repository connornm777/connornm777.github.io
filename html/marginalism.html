<h1>Labor and Profits</h1>
<p>
Karl Marx begins his magnus opus <em>Das Kapital</em> with an extended discussion about the concept of "value". 
He notes the fact that a coat made from wool is usually traded for more wool than it contains. Therefore, the labor that 
went into the coat commands some amount of wool, and this extra leverage commanded in trade is "value".
Owners who profit then must somehow be exploiting labor by capturing some "surplus value". 
</p>
<p>
I do not intend to have a long semantic debate about defining "value". 
But it can be shown that profits must come from exploiting labor is in general incorrect. 
Consider a coat factory that spends \(L\) amount on labor, 
and \(X\) amount on all expenses that aren't labor (land, machines, sheep, ect)<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. 
It's revenue is surely a function of these two input \(R(L, X)\), and it's profits would be:
</p>
$$P(L,X)=R(L,X)-L-X$$
<p>
If we were to create a clone of this factory, then we would simply double all these extensive variables. 
In other words, if we imagine we have twice as much labor <em> and </em> twice as much of everything else that produces revenue and profits, then
both our profits and revenue will double (ignoring network effects and economies of scale, and assuming the factory is small enough to not 
satiate consumer demand)<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>.  
</p>
$$R(2L, 2X)=2R(L, X)$$
$$\implies P(2L, 2X) = 2 P(L, X) $$
<p>
<p>
The revenue must surely be a increasing function with respect to increasing \(L\) and \(X\), because even in the worst case scenario where extra labor or other resources
aren't needed, you can pay some workers to do nothing or scrap the leftover resources. This doesn't decrease revenue. We must therefore have: 
</p>
$$R(2L, 2X) > R(2L, X) > R(L, X) $$
<p>
The more resources, whether \(L\) or \(X\), the more revenue. 
</p>
<p>
Whether profits are increased for each step is less clear. 
</p>
$$P(2L, X)-P(L,X) = R(2L, X) - R(L, X) - L > 0 ?$$
$$P(2L, 2X)-P(2L,X) = R(2L, 2X) - R(2L, X) - X > 0 ?$$
<p>
If our orginal profits were positive, then it is easy to see that \(P(2L, 2X)-P(L, X) > 0 \), and the net profits from doubling both \(X\) and \(L\) increases profits. 
But how does doubling labor alone effect profits?
The condition for doubling the labor to be profitable is seen to be:
</p>
$$ R(2L, X) - R(L, X) > L $$
<p>
Although we can assume that \(R(2L, X)\) is greater than \(R(L, X)\), we have no reason to assume that is greater than by an amount of at least \(L\). 
This allows for situations where <em>more</em> workers hired at the same wage make profits <em>fall</em>. Surely, if the labor theory of value were correct, 
then more workers at the same wage means more surplus labor value is extracted and profits should instead rise?
One can imagine a factory that has a dearth of machinary of floorspace, and the approximate net effect of hiring another worker is pay another 
salary for no appreciable increase in production or revenue.  
</p>
<h3> The form of \(R(L, X)\) </h3>
<p>
With my jabbing at Marx out of the way, I can now introduce my own speculative ideas about functional forms.
The revenue function of \(R(L, X)\) may take several possible forms, but should follow several constraints. 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The revenue should be zero if either the labor, or all factors needed for labor to produce are zero (having no workers, or having workers stand in an empty room should both
surely produce zero revenue):
$$ R(0, X)=R(L, 0)=0 $$ 
</li>
<li> 
The revenue should be monotonically increasing in both factors (more resources can't hurt revenue, at worst they can be discarded):
$$ R(L+dL, X) > R(L, X)  $$
$$ R(L, X+dX) > R(L, X) $$
</li>
<li>
As noted before, the argument given by doubling all variables applies to changing the scale by any amount \(s\):
$$R(sL, sX)=sR(L, X)$$
</li>
<li>
If given a large enough amount of \(L\), further increases in \(L\) do not increase revenue, and similarly for large \(X\) (having a million workers and ten wool spinner means 
revenue is going to depend much more on the change in number of wool spinners, and vice versa for the opposite situation). 
$$ R(L, \infty) = f(L) $$
$$ R(\infty, X) = g(X) $$
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Constraints 3 and 4 together force \(f(L)\) and \(g(X)\) to be linear:
</p>
$$f(L)=aL$$
$$g(X)=bX$$
<p>
Where \(a\) and \(b\) are constants defined as the ratio of a revenue to a resource when not constrained by the other resource. 
For profits to positive for some positive values of \(X\) and \(L\), both \(a\) and \(b\) must be greater than one.
</p>
<p>
A possible function (but not unique, though possibly simplest. Perhaps another constraint is needed) for \(R(L, X)\) that satisfies all the criterea is:
</p>
$$ R(L, X) = \left(\frac{1}{aL}+\frac{1}{bX}\right)^{-1}= \frac{abLX}{aL+bX} $$
<p>
The profit function is then:
</p>
$$ P(L, X) = \frac{abLX}{aL+bX}-L-X $$
<p>
One can then solve for the range in which \(P(2L, X)-P(L,X) > 0\) and finds that doubling \(L\) increases profits when \(L\) obeys:
</p>
$$0 < L < \frac{b}{2a}\left(\sqrt{7+2a}-3\right)X $$
<p>
I wanted to test this toy model empirically, but unfortunately, the companies that are large and publicly traded whose expenses are easier to find
are precisely those for which scale invariance and consumer non-saturation are bad assumptions. Additionally, this formula requires probing values of 
\(a\) and \(b\), for which a good fit requires examples of companies operating at a range of values of profitability. 
If anyone wants to run a business at a loss for an extended period of time to see how it fits this functional form I would very much 
appreciate it.  
Perhaps at a later date if I find a large dataset or way to scrape this information from a large number of businesses it can be tested. 
</p>
<p id="footnote-1">[1] One may object that allowing for the existence of \(X\) already assumes the negation of the labor theory of value, because maybe all of those 
other items derive their value from labor. First, I would object that there exists value in land not created by labor, but even with that aside, from the point of view 
of the factory, it doesn't matter. There are costs in paying employees, and costs in buying things for your employees to use, with a clear distinction between these costs.</p>
<p id="footnote-2">[2] This approximation is exact if you cloned the whole earth including the consumers and casually isolated the systems, 
and is a better approximation the more the system resembles that scenario. Another factory built in a geographically distinct market with little overlap between customers
and seperate workers for each factory should follow this approximation very well. </p>
