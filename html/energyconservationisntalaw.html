<h1>Energy Conservation is not a Law of Physics</h1>
<p>
Emily Noether was an accomplished mathematician, but she is best known in the physics world for
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem'>Noether's Theorem</a>. 
This theorem states that for any continuous symmetry of a physical system, there is an associated conserved quantity.  
While that sounds nice and all for neatly identifying all the usual conserved quantities in quantum field theory or other areas 
of mathematical physics, it struck me as carrying a deeper philosophical significance that I haven't seen otherwise emphasized or noted.
</p>
<p>
What is the actual basis for the scientific method? You may say that it is the process of creating a hypothesis, and testing it. 
Or maybe a way of accumulating knowledge about the world. But not all knowledge is considered scientific. 
What I had for breakfast this morning is knowledge, perhaps even uncommon knowledge, 
yet I imagine scientists are less curious about that than laws of thermodynamics. 
</p>
<p>
So what specifically classifies a type of knowledge as "scientific"? Perhaps you say "it needs to be verified through repeated experiment", 
or "it needs to generalize and explain a large number of phenomena".
But here lies a crucial bait and switch, and an important hidden assumption.
</p>
<p>
The proposition "Connor (I) had a croissant for breakfast on March 23, 2023" is true through out the universe, for all of time.
It may also be investigated through repeated forensic experiments of those who wish to investigate it's veracity. 
</p>
<p>
However, in order to make this statement universally and eternally true, I had to specify a time and place.  
When scientists discuss laws of physics, they typically don't say things such as 
"Newton's first law is true in 17th century England" (which is also a true proposition).
They are interested in phenomena and propositions that are true <em>regardless</em> of time and place <em>without</em> having to reference
a specific event, or contextual fact.  
</p>
<p>
This means scientists are in the business of studying <em>only that which is</em> time and space symmetric. This doesn't mean
the universe <em>is</em> time and space symmetric. The winner of the world cup 
and what I had for breakfast on this day are both pieces of knowledge that exist in the universe, but scientists are not interested in this knowledge
precisely because it is temporal and contextual. 
</p>
<p>
What does this have to do with conservation of energy? Well, that is just the name of the conserved quantity given by Noether's theorem associated
temporal invariance. The same goes for momentum and spatial symmetry. The big implication here is that conservation of energy 
(and momentum, and angular momentum for that matter) are not observed laws of the universe, but tautologies. 
They are built in assumptions that apply only to the phenomena that is temporally and spatially invariant. 
In other words, the scientist could be said to be someone who is interested in that which obeys conservation of energy, and is not 
interested in all the phenomena for which this doesn't apply.
